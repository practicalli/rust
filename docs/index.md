# Practicalli Rust

Practicalli Rust is a hands-on guide to using the Rust programming language throughout all the software development stages.

Live coding videos demonstrate the Rust workflow in action, showing how to get the most out of the unique approach the language provides.

Practical code examples are supported by discussions of the concepts behind Rust, including functional programming and effective tooling.
